# Fraud Detection By Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project aims to classify the fraud and healthy transactions in the provided dataset by kaggle.

### Road Map
-Data Preprocessing and cleaning for the machine learning models.

-Machine Learning Models with SKlearn

-Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow

-SemiSupervised Models with AutoEncoder

-Unsupervised methods, Anomaly Detection.

-Compare the results

# Scaled Data or Original Data?
Let's see whether the scaled dataset works better for the machine learning models or the original one.
